        <h2>What makes a hero???????????</h2>
        <p>According to Google, a hero is "Someone who is admired or idealized for courage, outstanding achievements or noble qualities." To me, a hero is someone to look up to, someone that inspires you.</p>
        <p> When I think of a hero, I think of Simone Biles, Olymipic gymnast. I have loved gymnastics since I was a little girl and I find Simone's story to be very inspiring. She was raised by her grandparents and overcame a lot of familial struggles to go on to become the greatest gymnast of all time. She just recenlty secured her 8th All-around national title at the U.S. Gymnastic Championships.</p>
